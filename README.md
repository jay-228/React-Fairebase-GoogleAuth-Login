==================== Project Description ====================

### **Assignment Overview:**

In this assignment, you'll implement two types of user authentication using Firebase:

1. **Email and Password Authentication**
2. **Google Sign-In Authentication**

Your goal is to create a basic web application that allows users to sign up, log in, and log out using both methods. This assignment will help you understand the basics of Firebase Authentication and how to integrate it into your JavaScript projects.

**Objective:** Implement a system where users can sign up and log in using their email and password.

**Steps:**

1. **Set Up Firebase Project:**
    - Create a new project on the Firebase Console.
    - Enable Email/Password authentication in the Firebase Authentication settings.
2. **Integrate Firebase into Your Project:**
    - Include Firebase in your web application.
    - Initialize Firebase using your project's configuration details.
3. **Create Sign-Up and Log-In Forms:**
    - Design a simple HTML form for user registration (sign-up) and another for login.
    - Include fields for email and password.
4. **Implement Authentication Logic:**
    - Use Firebase's `createUserWithEmailAndPassword` method for signing up users.
    - Use Firebase's `signInWithEmailAndPassword` method for logging in users.
    - Display appropriate error messages for failed sign-ups or logins.
